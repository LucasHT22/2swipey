# 2$wipey
At Hack Club's Campfire Flagship hackathon, each team was challenged to make a video game with weird controllers. Given a magnetic stripe reader, we made 2$wipey, where you use credit cards to break into a bank and fight your friend.

Decode the puzzle and break into a safe with your best buddy and then fight them super-smash style so you can have all the gold for yourself. Swipe the correct credit card to unlock the safe, and then swipe as fast as you can to shove your buddy off the edge of the platform.
